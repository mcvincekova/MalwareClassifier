# MalwareClassifier

## Requirements

* this project uses jupyter notebooks, for tutorial on usage see [jupyter-notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
* `requirements.txt` 
    * contains modules needed to execute the code which are not included in the standard python distribution (apart from the jupyter notebook)
    * to install run: `pip install --requirement requirements.txt`

## Project structure

* folder `Scripts` contains:
    * `TestDataExtraction` and `TrainDataExtraction` subfolders. 
        * Scripts within these folders are responsible for extraction of training and test data
    * `TrainFeaturesScaling`
        * Scales all training samples into the range `[0, 255]`
    * `SingleFeatureProcessing`
        * Contains overview of each feature together with a classifier based on each feature
    * `WholeFEatureSetClassification`
        * Contains LeNet-5 and random forest classifier for the whole feature set
    * `utilities`
        * contains helper classes and functions
* folder `Data.zip`:
    * contains only the final version of training and test features in `feature_merged_scaled` and `Data/test_data/test_features_merged_scaled`
    * the whole dataset is not provided as it is several GB in size, but it can be found in the [Ember dataset](https://github.com/endgameinc/ember)
    * upon downloading the following version: `ember_dataset_2018_2.tar.bz2` both training and test data can be extracted using corresponding `extract_to_csv.ipynb` jupyter notebook
